## System Overview
Wave is a great app. I tried to construct the structure of the application in a way, that's is easy to add new functionality. The code is seperated in  3 layers.

## Configuration
1. Clone (Download) source code
2. Install cocoapods
```
cd path/to/fr8/folder
pod install
```
If you don't have cocoapods installed follow instructions in this link

http://cocoapods.org/
```
$ sudo gem install cocoapods
```

3. Open wave.xcworkspace

Run the app

## Application structure
Application consists of 3 layers

* Presentation Layer
* Business Layer
* Data Layer

Also it includes Application folder with Configuration and AppDelegate and Core Classes.
